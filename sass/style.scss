// To be imported in the same format below

// Remember unless you want generated CSS to be in separate files, includes
// must start with an underscore or it will be generated as a separate file and not
// bundled into the main style.css in the css folder

// Any global styles (style used mostly on every page) should be defined
// in the sass/_global.scss file
