Startpress
==========

The best possible starting theme for Wordpress. Ever.

Support for; Custom taxonomies, custom post types, removal of default junk, support for AJAX requests, LESS CSS framework (including Semantic.gs grid system).

Clone into your wp-content/themes directory, edit style.css and change the name, then you're all set to go. This theme is perfect is you're building a site using a grid system (and if you're not), support for AJAX requests as well as a simplistic AJAX JSON API you can use to make simplistic requests within your theme.

This is the same code-base I use for client projects as well as projects I build on Wordpress at my day job.
